    "* **`External Network Pentest`:** Looks at an organization's security from the outside; this is hacking a network or machine from the outside. This heavily relies on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. OSINT helps gather as much data as possible that is publically available on the internet. These types of pentests are the most common because many compliance organizations dictate that an external network pentest must be performed annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Internal Network Pentest`:** Assesses an organization's security from the inside of the network, which means that the perimeter has already been breached. This heavily relies on Active Directory (AD) attacks as 90-95% of organizations use AD. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Web Application Pentest`:** The second most common type of penetration test, after the external. There is a broad attack surface and the methodology focuses on web-based attacks and the OWASP testing guidelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Wireless Pentest`:** Assesses an organization's wireless network security. Depending on the wireless type being used, the methodology will vary: if a guest network, segmentation will be tested; if WPA2-PSK is being used, the PSK will be tested for password strength; if WPA2 Enterprise is being used, several other attacks can be attempted. To perform a wireless pentest, a wireless network adapter will be needed to perform packet injection. \n",

    "**Physical Pentests** and **Social Engineering** assesses an organization's physical security and/or end-user training. The methodology depends on the task and goals of the organization. "

    "**1. `Reconnaissance`:** Gathering information about the target system or network. The goal is to collect as much information as possible to understand the target and identify potential entry points. There are two main forms:\n",
    "   * **Passive:** Collecting information about a target without directly interacting with the target system or network to remain undetected. This includes searching publicly available information, browsing websites, and examining DNS records.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Active:** Gathering information about a target network or system by actively engaging with it. It often involves techniques that directly interact with the target to obtain information, like sending pings, performing DNS queries, or using tools like Nmap to discover hosts and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `Scanning`:** Actively probe the target system or network to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. This step identifies potential weaknesses that can be exploited.\n",
    "   * Port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `Gaining Access`:** In this stage, the ethical hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network.\n",
    "   * Password cracking, social engineering, and exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system; essentially exploit vulnerabilities discovered during the scanning stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `Maintaining Access`:** Once access is gained, the hacker should aim to maintain access to the compromised system or network. The goal is to mimic the actions of a real attacker and assess the potential impact of a successful compromise\n",
    "   * Bypassing security mechanisms, setting up backdoors or remote access tools, and establishing persistent access.\n",
    "      \n",
    "**5. `Covering Tracks`:** The final step involves the hacker removing traces of their activities from the target system or network. The goal is to ensure that the hacking activity remains undetected, leaving no evidence of the penetration testing. \n",
    "   * Deleting logs, modifying or removing files, and restoring the system to its original state. \n"

    "While SNMP was created to monitor network device, it also transmits control commands using agents over **`UDP port 161`.** The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. It is always the client who actively requests information from the server; SNMP also enables the use of **`\"traps\" over UDP port 162`,** which are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side. For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides; this addressing mechanism for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into footprinting, the following concepts must be understood:\n",
    "* **`MIB`:** To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the **Management Information Base (MIB)** was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information.\n",
    "  * A MIB is a text file in which all querybale SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one **Object Identifier (OID),** which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object\n",
    "\n",
    "  * MIB files are written in the **Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)** based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`OID`:** An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them\n",
    "  * The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. A user can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the **Object Identifier Registry.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Community Strings`:** Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. \n",
    "  * It is important to note that many organizations are still using SNMPv2, as the transition to SNMPv3 can be very complex, but the services still need to remain active. This causes\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The lack of encryption of the data sent is also a problem because every time the community strings are sent over the network, they can be intercepted and read\n",
    "\n",

    "The following are potentially encounterable SNMP versions that can be found on machines:\n",
    "* **`SNMPv1`:** Used for network management and monitoring. Of course, this is the first version of the protocol and is still in use in many small networks. It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has no built-in authentication mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify the network data. Besides this, SNMPv1 does not support encryption, so the data can be easily intercepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SNMPv2`:** There are many versions of SNMPv2, but the primary version in use today is **`v2c`,** where the extenction **c** means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the community string that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SNMPv3`:** In SNMPv3, the security has been increased significantly. This includes authentication and transmission encryption (via PSK) of the data. However, the complexity also increases to the same extent, with significantly more configuration options than v2c. \n",

Since these community strings can be bound to any source, identifying the existing community strings can take some time. Before footprinting with snmpwalk, it is critical to scan the machine with nmap. \n",

    "   * This is why fuzzing allowed file extensions is crucial, as it enables attackers to explore what attacks are possible on the web server. \n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>XSS</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many file types may allow the introduction of a **Stored XSS** vulnerability to the web app by uploading maliciously crafted versions of them. The most basic example is when a web app allows users to upload HTML files. Although HTML files won't allow the execution of code, it would still be possible to implement JS code within them to carry an **XSS** or **CSRF** attack on whoever visits the uploaded HTML page. If the target sees a link from a website they trust, and the website is vulnerable to uploading HTML documents, it may be possible to trick them into visiting the link and carry the attack on their machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of XSS attacks is web apps that display an image's metadata after its upload. For such web apps, an XSS payload can be included in one of the metadata parameters that accept raw text, like the Comment parameter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "exiftool -Comment=' \"><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' xss.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If this command is done, the Comment parameter will be updated to the XSS payload. When the image's metadata is displayed, the XSS payload should be triggered, and the JS code will be executed to carry the XSS attack. Furthermore, if the image's MIME-Type is change to **`text/html`,** some web apps may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "XSS attacks can also be carried with SVG images, along with several other attacks. SVG images are XML-based, and they describe 2D vector graphics, which the browser renders into an image. For this reason, their XML data can be modified to include an XSS payload:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\">\n",

    "    <script type=\"text/javascript\">alert(window.origin);</script>\n",
    "</svg>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the image is uploaded to the web app, the XSS payload will be triggered whenever the image is displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any of these attacks, try any XSS payload that can lead to RCE. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>XXE</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "With SVG images, malicious XML data can be included to leak the source code of the web app, and other internal documents within the server. The following shows how XXE can be used with an SVG image to leak the content of `/etc/passwd`:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> ]>\n",
    "<svg>&xxe;</svg>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the above SVG image is uploaded and viewed, the XML document would get processed, and the attacker should get the info of `/etc/passwd` printed on the page or shown in the page source. Similarly, if the web app allows the upload of XML documents, then the same payload can carry the same attack when the XML data is displayed on the web app. \n",
    "\n",
    "While reading system files like `/etc/passwd` can be useful for server enumeration, it can have an even more significant benefit for web pentesting, as it allows the attacker to read the web app's source files. Access to the source code will enable attackers to find more vulnerabilities to exploit within the web app through **Whitebox Pentesting.** For file upload exploitation, it may allow an attacker to locate the upload directory, identify allowed extensions, or find the file naming scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use XXE to read source code in PHP web apps, the following payload can be used within a malicious SVG image:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php\"> ]>\n",
    "<svg>&xxe;</svg>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the SVG image is displayed, a base64 encoded version of index.php will be output, which can be decoded to read the source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using XML data is not unique to SVG images, as it is also used by many types of documents, like **PDF, Word, Powerpoint, etc;** all of these documents include XML data within them to specify their format and structure. An SSRF attack can also be conducted: an XXE vulnerability can be used to enumerate the internally available services or call private APIs to perform private actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>DoS</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "An XXE payload, in tandem with a file upload vulnerability, may be used to achieve DoS. Also, Decompression bombs with file types that use data compression, like ZIP archives can cause a DoS if the web app automatically unzips a ZIP archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Pixel Flood** attack can be used with some image files that use image compression, like JPG or PNG. A JPG image file can be created with any image size, and then have its compression data modified to have a size of (0xffff x 0xffff), which woud result in an image with a size of 4 Gigapixels. When the web app tries to display this image, it will attempt to allocate all of its memory to this image, resulting in a crash on the back-end server. "

In CentOS, a lot of the routing occurs at the firewall, as it manages the rules of the connected network, specifically who's not allowed to send traffic across networks. Therefore, the firewall configuration should be checked first:\n",

Of course, the interface(s) can be changed to another zone to have a different set of rules applied to it. \n",

Assign Interfaces to the External and Internal Zones via ifcg:** The previously configured interfaces can both be assigned to the public zone and allow routing, however, it is not an ideal configuration. An interface can be assigned to a different zone that is designed to enable routing. The zones that are best equipped for this are the **External Zone** and the **Internal Zone.** There are two basic ways to do this\n",

    "**5. Set up Gateway for Internal Machines:** The internal machines must have a gateway to access external networks. In order for the traffic on the internal machines to find their way back, gateways must be configured. **The gateway of these internal machines must be the internal IP address of the router,** so if a request comes in, it will get forwarded to the respective internal machine (due to the router's port forwarding), and when the internal machine responds, it will send the traffic through its default gateway (router's internal IP address) which will send the traffic to the external side due to masquerading. **The following command is done on the internal machine, NOT ON THE ROUTER.**\n",

Unfortunately, the shell only allows the execution of the ls command with a specific set of arguments, such as ls -l or ls -a, but it does not allow the execution of any other commands. In this situation, command injection can be used to escape from the shell by ibjecting additional commands into the argument of the ls command.

With shared directories, specific directories or files on the host system can be made accessible within the container. This is useful for persisting data, sharing code, and facilitating collaboration between development environments and Docker containers; however, it always depends on the setup of the environment and the goals that administrators want to achieve. To create a shared directory, a path on the host system and a corresponding path within the container is specified, creating a direct link between the two locations. \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**2. Docker [daemon] Sockets:** A special file that allows admins and processes to communicate with the Docker dameon. This communication occurs either through a Unix socket or a network socket, depending on the configuration of the Docker setup. It acts as a bridge, facilitating communication between the Docker client and the Docker daemon. When issuing a command through the Docker CLI, the Docker client sends the command to the Docker socket, and the Docker daemon, in turn processes the command and carries out the requested actions.\n",

This remote API access expands the possibilities for distributed Docker setups and remote management scenarios; however, depending on the configuration, there are many ways where automated processes or tasks can be stored. Those files can contain useful information for attackers to escape the Docker container\n",

This can be confirmed by the `id` command. Alternatively, Docker may have SUID set, or the logged in user may be in the Sudoers file, which permits them to run docker as root. All three options allow privilege escalation through Docker. \n",

As a result, Kubernetes has become a go-to solution for organizations looking to streamline their development processes and improve efficiency. Other K8 security measures include Cluster infrastructure security, cluster configuration security, application security, and data security.\n",

    "Kubernetes revolves around the conept of pods, which can hold 1+ closely connected containers. Each pod functions as a separate virtual machine on a node, complete with its own IP, hostname, and other details. Kubernetes simplifies the management of multiple containers by offering tools for load balancing, service discovery, storage orchestration, self-healing, etc. Despite challenges in security and management, K8s containues to grow and improve with features like RBAC, network policies, and security contexts, providing a safer environment for applications. \n",

    "The K8s architecture comprises a master node and worker nodes, each with specific roles: \n",
    "* **`Control Plane (master node)`:** Responsible for controlling the Kubernetes clusted. The master node hosts the Kubernetes Control Plane, which manages and coordinates all activities within the cluster and it also ensures that the cluster's desired state is maintained. \n",
    "   * The master mode covers versatility in accommodating various needs, such as supporting databases, AI/ML workload, and cloud-native microservices. It's capable of managing high-resource applications at the edge and is compatible with different platforms, so it can be used on public CSPs or private on-premises data centers\n",
    "   * The master node serves as the management layer, and consists of several crucial components, each enabling the control plane to make decisions and provide a comprehensive view of the entire cluster:\n",
    "      * **etcd:** TCP/2379 & TCP/2380\n",
    "      * **API server:** TCP/6443\n",
    "      * **Scheduler:** TCP/10251\n",
    "      * **Controller Manager:** TCP/10252\n",
    "      * **Kubelet API:** TCP/10250\n",
    "      * **Read-Only Kubelet API:** TCP/10255\n",
    "* **`Worker Nodes (minions)`:** Where the containerized applications are run. Minions execute the actual applications and they receive instructions from the Control Plane and ensure the desired state is achieved. \n",
    "   * Within a containerized environment, the Minions serve as the designated location for running applications. It's important to note that each node is managed and resgulated by the Control Plane, which helps ensure that all processes running within the containers operate smoothly and efficiently\n",
    "   * The Scheduler, based on the API server, undertsands the state of the cluster and schedules new pods on the nodes accordingly. After deciding which node a pod should run on, the API server updates the etcd\n",
    "   * The API server is the entry point for all the administrative commands, either from users via kubectl or from the controllers. This server communicates with etcd to fetch or update the cluster state\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of Kubernetes architecture is its API, which serves as the main point of contact for all internal and external interactions. **The Kubernetes API has been designed to support declarative control, allowing users to define their desired state for the system.** This enables Kubernetes to take the necessary steps to implement the desired state. The **`kube-apiserver`** is responsible for hosting the API, which handles and verifies RESTful requests for modifying the system's state. These requests can involve creating, modifying, deleting, and retrieving information related to various resources within the system. Overall, the Kubernetes API plays a crucial role in facilitating seamless communication and contorl within the Kubernetes cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Kubernetes framework, an API resource serves as an endpoint that houses a specific collection of API objects. These objects pertain to a particular category and include essential elements such as Pods, Services, and Deployements, etc. Each unique resource comes equipped with a distinct set of operations that can be executed, inlcuding but not limited to:\n",
    "* **GET:** Retrieves information about a resource or a list of resources\n",
    "* **POST:** Creates a new resource\n",
    "* **PUT:** Updates an existing resource\n",
    "* **PATCH:** Applies partial updates to a resource\n",
    "* **DELETE:** Removes a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of authentication, Kubernetes supports various methods such as client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth, which serve to verify the user's identity. Once the user has been authenticated, Kubernetes enforces authorization decisions using RBAC. This technique involves assigning specific roles to users or processes with corresponding permissions to access and operate on resources; therefore, Kubernetes' authentication and authorization process is a comprehensive security measure that ensures only authorized users can access resources and perform operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Kubernetes, the kubelet can be configured to permit anonymous access. By default, the Kubelet allows anonymous access. **Anonymous requests are considered unauthenticated, which implies that any request made to the kubelet without a valid client certificate will be treated as anonymous.** This can be problematic as any process or user that can reach the Kubelet API can make requests and receive responses, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unauthorized actions:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://<IP Address>:6443 -k\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query will show whether anonymous access has been disabled on the Kubernetes API in the response: the value of the message key. In the message key, the **`System:anonymous`** will be present, which typically represents an unauthenticated user, meaning that access to the API server is anonymous attempted. In the example, the root path is attempted, which would grant significant control over the Kubernetes cluster if successful; by default, access to the root path is generally restricted to authenticated and authorized users with administrative privileges and the API serer will likely deny the request with a 403 Forbidden status code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command will display the names, namespaces, creation, timestamps, and container images of the pods. It also shows the last applied configuration for each pod, which could contain confidential details regarding the container images and their pull policies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://<IP Address>:10250/pods -k | jq .\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Understanding the container images and their versions used in the cluster can enable an attacker to identify known vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. Namespace information can provide insights into how the pods and resources are arranged within the cluster, which can be used to target specific namespaces with known vulnerabilities. Metadata, like uid and resourceVersion, can be used to perform reconnaissance and recognie potential targets for further attacks. Disclosing the last appliced configuration can potentially expose sensitive information, such as passwords, secrets, or API tokens used during the deployment of the pods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pods can be further analyzed with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubeletctl -i --server <IP Address> pods\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To effectively interact with pods within the Kubernetes environment, it's important to have a clear understanding of the available commands. One approach that can be particularly useful is used the `scan rce` command in kubeletctl, which provides efficient management of pods:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubeletctl -i --server <IP Address> scan rce\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is also possible to interactively engage with a container and gain insight into the extent of the privileges within it. This allows attackers to better understand the level of access and control over the container's contents:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubeletctl -i --server <IP Address> exec \"id\" -p nginx -c nginx      #-p is the pod name; -c is the container name\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If successful, the output of the command shows that the current user executing the id command inside the container has root privileges. This would indicate that administrative access has been gained within the container, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities. If access to a container with root privileges is gained, further actions on the host system or other containers can be performed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Privilege Escalation</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain higher privileges and access the host system, `kubeletctl` can be used to obtain the Kubernetes service account's token and certificate (ca.crt) from the server. To do this, the server's IP address, namespace, and target pod must be specified. In case the token and certificate are received, the privileges can be elevated even more, allowing lateral movement throughout the cluster and gaining access to additional pods and resources:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubeletctl -i --server <IP Address> exec \"cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token\" -p nginx -c nginx | tee -a k8.token    #token extract\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the token and certificate have been extracted, check the access rights in the Kubernetes cluster. This is commonly used for auditing and verification to guarantee that users have the correct level of access and are not given more privileges than they need; however, it can be used to inquire about user permissions to perform different actions on various resources:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export token=`cat k8.token`\n",
    "\n",
    "kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://<IP Address>:6443 auth can-i --list     #lists privileges\n",

    "Of course, the outpit of this command will vary, but it may say selfsubject-resources, meaning pods can be received, created, and listed (which are the resources representing the running container in the cluster). From here, a YAML file can be created to create a new container and mount the entire root filesystem from the host system into this container's /root directory.

    "\n",
    "**<u>Wrong Write Permissions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being on a target machine that is connected to the company's intranet and the target works with Python. There are three connected components. The Python script imports a python module and the privileges of the script as well as the permissions of the module. One or another Python module may have write permissions set for all users by mistake. This allows the Python module to be edited and manipulated so that an attacker can insert commands or functions that will escalate privileges. If SUIF/SGID permissions have been assigned to the Python script that imports this module, the code will automatically be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by looking at the set permissions of the script to determine whether it has a SUID set. If set, the script can be executed with the privileges of another user, potentially even root. View the script and read its contents if possible. In this case, the following script is on the target machine with SUID set:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Available memory: {round(available_memory, 2)}%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "While script is simple, the main points of focus are the imported module (psutil) and the function from the module (virtual_memory()). Look for this function in the folder of psutil and check if the module has write permissions:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep -r \"def virtual_memory\" /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/*\n",

    "If in a developer environment, this will likely have write permissions for everyone, as many developers work on different scripts and may require higher privileges. In this case, the following is the exact portion of the library that can be edited as it is the function being called:\n",

    "It is recommended to **put the malicious code right at the beginning of the function.** There, everything can be inserted that is correct and effective. Import the module os for testing purposes, which allows an attacker to execute system commands. With this, insert the command id and check during the execution of the script if the inserted code is executed:\n",

    "   return ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now run the script with sudo to see if the id of the root user is displayed. If this works, edit the library and insert a reverse shell that connects to the local machine as root to escalate privileges:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo /usr/bin/python3 ./<file.py>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Library Path</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, each version has a specified order in which modules are searched and imported from. The order in which Python imports modules from are based on a priority system, meaning that paths higher on the list take priority over ones lower on the list. This can be seen by issuing the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -c 'import sys; print(\"\\n\".join(sys.path))'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use this variant, two prerequisites are necessary:\n",
    "1. The module that is imported by the script is located under one of the lower priority paths listed via the PYTHONPATH variable \n",
    "2. Write permissions to one of the paths having a higher priority on the list are required\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the imported module is located in a path lower on the list and a higher priority path is editable by the logged-in user, **a module can be created with the same name that includes malicious functions.** Since the higher priority path is read earlier and examined for the module in question, Python accesses the first hit it finds and imports it before reaching the original and intended module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to make sense, the previous script will be used that includes the psutil module. To see psutil's default installation location, use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 show psutil | grep \"Location:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "From this example, psutil is installed in the `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages` path. From the listing of the PYTHONPATH variable, there may be several directories to choose from to see if there might be any misconfigurations in the environment that allow write access. Check with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -la /usr/lib/python3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "After checking all of the directories listed, the `/usr/lib/python3.8` path may be misconfigued in a way to allow any user to write to it. Cross-check with values from the `PYTHONPATH` variable to see of the path is higher on the list than the path in which psutil is installed in. This misconfiguration can be abused to create a psutil module containing a malicious virtual_memory() function within the /usr/lib/python3.8 directory:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to get to this point, a file named `psutil.py` must be creating containing the contents listed above in the previously mentioned directory. It is important to make sure that the created module has the same name as the import as well as having the same function with the correct number of arguments passed to it as the function that is going to be hijacked. This is critical as without either of these conditions being true, this attack will not work. After creating this file containing the example of the previous hijacking script, the system will be prepped for exploitation. Run the script again using sudo; if it works edit the file to create a reverse shell that connects to the local machine as root to escalate privileges:\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "**<u>PYTHONPATH Environment Variable</u>**\n",

    "PYTHONPATH is an environment variable that indicates what directory (or directories) Python can search for modules to import. This is important because if a user is allowed to manipulate and set this variable while running the python binary, they can redirect Python's search functionality to a user-defined location when it comes time to import modules. To see if the logged-in user has the permissions to set environment variables for the Python binary, check the sudo permissions with `sudo -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `/usr/bin/python3` can be run with sudo privileges and NOPASSWD, the environment variables can be set by the `SETENV:` flag. Due to the trusted nature of sudo, any environment variables defined before calling the binary are not subject to any restrictions regarding being able to set environment variables, meaning that using the `/usr/bin/python3` binary enables setting environment variables under the context of a running program. \n",

    "**Application Context** is used to profine fine-grain access in VPDs and in general. Application context, or functionality specific to Oracle, allows a DBA to set database application variables that can be retrieved by database sessions.

It is a namespace that helps programmers and applications that are running against the database get basic information in the application, have that stored in memory.

With VPDs, the security policies are attached to database objects and are automatically enforced throughout the entire database, either at the row or column level.
